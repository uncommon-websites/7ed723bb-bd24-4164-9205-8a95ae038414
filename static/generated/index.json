    "prompt": "Editorial documentary photograph of a small business owner in their established retail store, captured in warm natural window light with shallow depth of field (f/2.8-f/4). The owner (age 35-55) stands behind a worn wooden counter surrounded by real inventory and authentic, lived-in details—scuffed floors, handwritten notes, personal touches like a houseplant or family photo. The composition uses the rule of thirds with generous negative space in soft, warm Stone gray tones. The owner's expression shows quiet confidence and gentle satisfaction, not a broad smile. Natural body language: hands resting on the counter or lightly touching merchandise. The environment feels specific and textured—morning or late afternoon light, warm interior fixtures, subtle emerald and amber accents. No visible technology, screens, or text. Slight grain and slightly desaturated colors for documentary realism.",
